This is a free-time project that I created sometime ago. Not sure if
it will be continued, and definitely no idea when it will happen. You're free
to improve the bot further should you find it useful, or make suggestions.

For the code to work, please paste your own ouath code to cfg.py in the "PASS" field. Otherwise the bot will not work. 
Likewise, the channel will have to be re-specified if you wish to use it
on your own/someone elses channel. By default it goes to twitch.tv/capu_streams
. For all of this, you need to create a new twitch account. Remember to specify
the name of the account in the "USER" field.
